\chapter{Package}
That work is mostly empirical as well as turned upon numerical simulations/estimations. For that reason, we built an array of tools for working on Hawkes process. We describe these here; some of them are re-usable for other project, and we include them in the personal library of the author, while the rest is specialized for Hawkes processes.

With that project, I started writing my own libraries. Here is the link to my github in order to download them if anyone needs them.
