This paper sums-up the different methods for simulating Poisson point processes in order to be able to simulate Hawkes processes. We remind the definition of those in a first part. 

A conclusive comparison of some of the classical methods (up to 2020) is available in appendix. 

We also deal with Hawkes' parameters estimation. We wanted to introduce a systematic method for time-dependant parameters estimation relying on kernel estimation. Our ideas come from KDE's theory. We introduce a new function that is able to detect local changes in time-estimation and reduce the window's size in order to have more precise estimate. The new function is described in theorem \ref{thrm:new_g} and the adaptive algorithm in algorithm \ref{algo:adaptive2}.

Finally, we were interested in how change point analysis can be integrated in that domain, when there are discontinuities in the parameters' function.
