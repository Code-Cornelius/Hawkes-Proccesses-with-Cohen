All that work was nourished by Dr. Edward Cohen without whom I wouldn't have been able to study all those different topics. I learnt a lot and I earned some self confidence through this work. I am deeply thankful for his time, patience, and consideration. 

I also want to thank Imperial College as well as EPFL for approving my application for a year abroad. Spending a year in London was a wonderful experience.

I would like to thank anonymous referees for pointing out useful references, and for various helpful suggestions. 

Finally, Iâ€™m grateful for the genuine pieces of advice I have been given by the professors I had during my final year of Bachelor. They were all very attentive to my questions. In particular, I think about Ms. Almut Veraart who introduced me to point processes.
